INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.

 * After installing Drupal 7 Core and all module dependencies, install the DIRT
   Core module.

 * To add a web-based data search portal to the site, install the (optional) 
   DIRT DataTable module.

   Note: these modules must be installed through the Drupal interface. The
   installation uses the Batch API which is not compatible with installing with
   drush or other command line tools.
